##Syllabus

**Lesson 1: Changing Expectations**

We'll first start by building a project the way you already know how: without an overarching organizational paradigm. Specifically, we'll discuss pain points and difficulties that are easy to run into when you don't use an organizational model. Then, we'll discuss a paradigm that will help us in the future, and weâ€™ll see some examples of that paradigm in action.

**Lesson 2: Refactoring**

We'll spend some time discussing how our new paradigm applies to the project we worked on in Lesson 1. Then we'll rebuild the project with the new organizational paradigm.

**Lesson 3: Using an Organizational Library**

We'll explore how to use KnockoutJS, an organizational library, to organize our code and to reduce the amount of boilerplate code we write. Our resulting application will be well-organized, easy to understand, and extendable.

**Lesson 4: Exploring Unfamiliar Code**

In this final lesson, we'll spend some time talking about how to explore code that you didn't write, possibly even using a library or framework that you aren't familiar with. Exploration is one of the most important skills for a developer to foster. and this lesson will get you started on that journey.
